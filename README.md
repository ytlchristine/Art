## Personal Peices
As I mentioned ealrier, I do art myself! I find that art is relaxing to do and lets you explore new possibilities without pressure. I enjoy drawing in my free time (though I don't have much these days) and for friends. Many of my peices are just doodles, but here are a few that can be presented as whole peices:

This was a gift for my dear friend's fifteenth birthday; It's her as a character from Genshin Impact.

A faster drawing of Tartaglia/Childe from Genshin Impact on his birthday (You may start to notice a trend in what I currenly like drawing,haha).

As I said, a lot of what I draw are sketches and not full peices! Here's one of the better sketches I've done recently, one of Yanfei from, of course, Genshin Impact.

# Welcome

Hello, welcome to this website! My name is Christine Liu and this site simply goes over some media that I enjoy and some art that I've done myself. Please enjoy your time here. :-)

## Personal Peices
As I mentioned earlier, I do art myself! I find that art is relaxing to do and lets you explore new possibilities without pressure. I enjoy drawing in my free time (though I don't have much these days) and for friends. Many of my peices are just doodles, but here are a few that can be presented as whole peices:

This was a gift for my dear friend of mine's fifteenth birthday; It's her as a character from Genshin Impact.

A quick-ish drawing of Tartaglia/Childe from Genshin Impact on his birthday (You may start to notice a trend in what I currenly like drawing, haha).

As I said, a lot of what I draw are sketches and not full peices! Here's one of the better sketches I've done recently, one of Yanfei from, of course, Genshin Impact.


I'd love to work on improving on my art (adding backgrounds, rendering further, etc.)! But until then, those are some peices that I'm rather proud of creating! 



## Admired Artists
I take most of my style's inspiration from various artists that I scross across on the internet, but there are a few artists whose art I really enjoy or from which I would like to get inspiration from! 


[Airi](https://twitter.com/pix_bun) || I seriously admire their understanding of composition, color theory, and lighting. I would love to have such vibrant palettes.

[Po豆](https://twitter.com/psta_0) || I love how naturally their colors flow, and their style is very unique! Their pinned peice I especially appreciate because of how satisfyingly thick the line art is.



There are more, but I'll just show these for now! :-)



## Music/Songs
Actually, I like all types of music (yes, including country, since my dad loves it), so I tend to like most everything I hear. Here are a few songs that I don't find myself getting tired of any time soon:
